Bellman-Ford(Graph, source):
1. Initialize distance[] = INFINITY and distance[source] = 0
2. For i from 1 to size(vertices) - 1:
     For each edge (u, v) with weight w in edges:
         If distance[u] + w < distance[v]:
             distance[v] = distance[u] + w
3. For each edge (u, v) with weight w in edges:
     If distance[u] + w < distance[v]:
         print "Graph contains negative weight cycle"
4. Return distance[]

The key insight of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is that
the shortest path from the source to any other vertex in a graph with |V| vertices must have at most |V| - 1 edges.
If a shorter path is found that uses |V| or more edges,
then there's a negative weight cycle in the graph.
